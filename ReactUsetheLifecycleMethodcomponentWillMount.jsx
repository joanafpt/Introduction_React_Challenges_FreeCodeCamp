//React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount
/* The componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within componentWillMount() - you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.*/

    constructor(props) {

      return <div />
