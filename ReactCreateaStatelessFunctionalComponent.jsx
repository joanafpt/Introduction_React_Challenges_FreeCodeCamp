//React: Create a Stateless Functional Component
/*
The code editor has a function called MyComponent. Complete this function so it returns a single div element which contains some string of text.

Note: The text is considered a child of the div element, so you will not be able to use a self-closing tag.
*/
const MyComponent = function() {
  // change code below this line
  return (
    <div> text= "stringOfText" </div>
  );


  // change code above this line
}
